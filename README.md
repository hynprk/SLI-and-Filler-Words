**Summary**
Speech pathologists are eager to understand the underlying reasons of specific language impairment (SLI) in children. Hence, this paper investigates the causal relationship between the treatment (SLI) and the average number of filler words (outcome) using propensity score matching (PSM) in order to understand how speech planning differs between language impaired children and typically developing (TD) children. Results relay that there is not a significant difference between the average number of filler words between SLI and TD children, and that the treatment is not useful in predicting the effect of it towards the outcome. In conclusion, there is no difference in the process of speech planning between treated and untreated children; however, this could be an issue of a Type II error, due to the limitations of PSM.
